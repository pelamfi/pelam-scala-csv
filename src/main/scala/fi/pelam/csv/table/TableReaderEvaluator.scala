 * @param errors initialized by default into value that is "worse" than any actual error produced by [[TableReader]].

 * @tparam RT The client specific row type.
 *
 * @tparam CT The client specific column type.
 *
 * @tparam M The type of the `metadata` parameter. Must be a sub type of [[TableMetadata]].
 *           This specifies the character set and separator to use when reading the CSV data from the input stream.
