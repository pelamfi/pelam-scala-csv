/**
 * Base class for metadata attached to [[Table]].
 *
 * Idea is that client code can extend this trait and piggyback whatever
 * extraneous data to [[Table]] instances.
 *
 * One example is the details of the CSV
 * format used. They are convenient to keep with the Table data in case user
 * needs to save a modified version of the original CSV file from which the data was read
 * from.
 *
 * Another use for this metadata mechanism is during the process of autodetecting
 * details of the CSV format by [[TableReader]].
 *
 * This trait has two variables that TableReader can use directly.
 *
 * For more complex format detection heuristics, this can be inherited
 * and extended with variables that a more custom detection algorithm then tries to detect.
